# Thoughter

Definitely not a Twitter clone.

Author: David Steed

Project Purpose:  Learn to use testing framework further, and also learn to refactor code as necessary while composing and conducting unit tests.

Assignment:  Use test framework (Mocha, Chai, Karma) to evaluate function window.thoughter.showRecent in file recent-thoughts.js.

Critical Path:
1.  Validate one basic sanity check
2.  List all basic checks. 
3.  List all critical checks.
4.  List any "edge case" checks, if needed
5.  Create a list of unit tests that intelligently combine as many of the above
6.  Validate unit tests and correct source code as needed
7.  List changes to the file recent-thoughts.js ?

What tech used for test:
    "chai": "^3.5.0",
    "karma": "^1.5.0",
    "karma-chai": "^0.1.0",
    "karma-chrome-launcher": "^2.0.0",
    "karma-mocha": "^1.3.0",
    "mocha": "^3.2.0",

    Atom text editor
    Chrome browser
    jshint

    install test framework as follows:
    $ npm init
    $ npm install mocha --save-dev
    $ npm install --save-dev karma chai karma-mocha karma-chai karma-chrome-launcher
